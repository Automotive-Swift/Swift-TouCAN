### macOS&reg; User-Space Driver for TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku

# Running CAN on a Mac&reg;

_Running CAN on a Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The macOS driver for TouCAN USB interfaces from [Rusoku](https://www.rusoku.com) is based on _MacCAN-Core_ which is an abstraction (or rather a wrapper) of Apple´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## MacCAN-TouCAN

This repo contains the source code for the _MacCAN-TouCAN_ driver and several alternatives to build dynamic libraries for macOS,
either as a C++ class library ([_libTouCAN_](#libTouCAN)),
or as a _CAN API V3_ driver library ([_libUVCANTOU_](#libUVCANTOU)),
or as a _VSCP CANAL_ compatible library ([_libCANAL_](#libCANAL)),
as well as some C/C++ example programs ([`can_moni`](can_moni-for-maccan-toucan) and [`can_test`](can_test-for-maccan-toucan)).

### Build Targets

_Important note_: To build any of the following build targets run the `build_no.sh` script to generate a pseudo build number.
```
uv-pc013mac:~ eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ ./build_no.sh
```
Repeat this step after each `git commit`, `git pull`, `git clone`, etc.

Then you can build all targets by typing the usual commands:
```
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ make clean
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ make all
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ sudo make install
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$
```
_(The version number of the library can be adapted by editing the appropriated `Makefile` and changing the variable `VERSION` accordingly. Don´t forget to set the version number also in the source files.)_

#### libTouCAN

___libTouCAN___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C++__ applications.
See header file `TouCAN.h` for a description of all class members.

#### libUVCANTOU

___libUVCANTOU___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `can_api.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### libCANAL (_Sorry, not realized yet!_)

___libCANAL___ is a dynamic library with a VSCP CANAL compatible application programming interface.
The TouCAN USB hardware is delivered with a CANAL (CAN Application Layer) DLL for Windows.
See [Rusoku](https://github.com/rusoku)´s GitHub page for further information.

#### can_moni for MacCAN-TouCAN

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`). Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni --help` to display all program options.

#### can_test for MacCAN-TouCAN

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, I´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test --help` to display all program options.

### Target Platform

- Apple´s macOS (x86_64)

### Development Environment

#### macOS Big Sur

- macOS Big Sur (11.1) on a MacBook Pro (2019)
- Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)
- Xcode Version 12.3 (12C33)

#### macOS High Sierra

- macOS High Sierra (10.13.6) on a MacBook Pro (late 2011)
- Apple LLVM version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)
- Xcode Version 10.1 (10B61)

### CAN Hardware

- TouCAN USB (Model F4FS1, Hardware 1.0.0, Firmware 1.0.1)

## Known Bugs and Caveats

- For a list of bugs and caveats see [issues](https://github.com/mac-can/RusokuCAN/issues) tracked in the GitHub repo.
## This and That

For reasons unknown to me, the artifacts build with Xcode detect the TouCAN USB adapter only under macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and higher.
The artifacts build by Makefile also detect the adapter under macOS 10.13 (High Sierra).
So I hope that the artifacts build by Makefile are backward compatible up to version 10.6 (Mountain Lion) of the world´s mostest advanced OS.
