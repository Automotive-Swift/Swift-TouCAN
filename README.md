### macOS&reg; User-Space Driver for TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku

# Running CAN on a Mac&reg;

_Running CAN on a Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The macOS driver for TouCAN USB interfaces from [Rusoku](https://www.rusoku.com) is based on _MacCAN-Core_ which is an abstraction (or rather a wrapper) of Apple´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## MacCAN-TouCAN

This repo contains the source code for the _MacCAN-TouCAN_ driver and several alternatives to build dynamic libraries for macOS,
either as a C++ class library ([_libTouCAN_](#libTouCAN)),
or as a _CAN API V3_ driver library ([_libUVCANTOU_](#libUVCANTOU)),
or as a _VSCP CANAL_ compatible library ([_libCANAL_](#libCANAL)),
as well as some C/C++ example programs ([`can_moni`](can_moni-for-maccan-toucan) and [`can_test`](can_test-for-maccan-toucan)).

### Build Targets

_Important note_: To build any of the following build targets run the `build_no.sh` script to generate a pseudo build number.
```
uv-pc013mac:~ eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN/Sources/
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ ./build_no.sh
```
Repeat this step after each `git commit`, `git pull`, `git clone`, etc.

#### libTouCAN

This is a Xcode project, developed with Xcode 12.3 for macOS 11.1 (Big Sur).

___libTouCAN___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C++__ applications.
See header file `TouCAN.h` for a description of all class members.

#### libUVCANTOU

This is a `Makefile` project, so type the usual commands:
```
uv-pc013mac:Sources eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN/Library/CANAPI/
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ make clean
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ make all
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$ sudo make install
uv-pc013mac:CANAPI eris$
```
_(The version number of the library can be adapted by editing the `Makefile` and changing the variable `VERSION` accordingly.)_

___libUVCANTOU___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `can_api.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### libCANAL

_Sorry, not realized yet!_

___libCANAL___ is a dynamic library with a VSCP CANAL compatible application programming interface.
The TouCAN USB hardware is delivered with a CANAL (CAN Application Layer) DLL for Windows.
See [Rusoku](https://github.com/rusoku)´s GitHub page for further information.

#### can_moni for MacCAN-TouCAN

This is a Xcode project, developed with Xcode 12.3 for macOS 11.1 (Big Sur).

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`). Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni --help` to display all program options.

#### can_test for MacCAN-TouCAN

This is a Xcode project, developed with Xcode 12.3 for macOS 11.1 (Big Sur).

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, I´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test --help` to display all program options.

## This and That

For reasons unknown to me, the Xcode targets recognize the TouCAN USB adapter only under macOS 10.15 (Catalina). The Makefile targets also recognize the adapter under macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). So I hope that the Makefile targets are downward compatible up to version 10.6 (Mountain Lion) of the world´s mostest advanced OS.
