# Swift module wrapping the TouCAN C-based CANAPI driver for the Swift Package Manager (SPM) with a nice API.

## Some notes to consider

* CANFD are frames not supported yet.
* Automatic ISOTP segmentation is not supported by CANAPI, but will eventually be provided by this module.
* Hardware filtering is not supported by the TouCAN adapter, but will eventually be provided by this module.
